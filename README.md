# Project Information

## Question 1: What is package.json file?
The `package.json` file stores the details of our project related to coding such as:
- Project name
- Version of the project
- Git repository
- Commands
- List of installed packages


## Question 2: Is Node.js single-threaded or multi-threaded?
Node.js is single-threaded.

## Question 3: Explain the difference between single-threaded and multi-threaded.
- **Single-threaded**: Runs one command at a time.
- **Multi-threaded**: Can run more than one command at a time.

## Question 4: What will you do if the node_modules folder of your project is deleted?
Just run the command `npm install` and it will recreate all the packages inside a `node_modules` folder that are listed inside the `package.json` file.

## Question 5: Should we push the node_modules folder to GitHub?
No, because the `node_modules` folder is very large and pushing it to GitHub can waste a lot of time. Instead, mention its path inside the `.gitignore` file and then push your code.



## What is HTTP?
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a set of rule which is used for transferring the files like, audio, video, graphic image, text and other multimedia files on the WWW (World Wide Web). HTTP is a protocol that is used to transfer the hypertext from the client end to the server end, but HTTP does not have any security. Whenever a user opens their Web Browser, that means the user indirectly uses HTTP.

## What are HTTP Request Messages?
HTTP Requests are messages which are sent by the client or user to initiate an action on the server.

It consists of various things:

- **a**. Request Line: The Request-Line starts with a method token, which is followed by the Request-URI, the protocol version, and ending with CRLF. Using the SP characters, the elements are separated.

Syntax

Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP HTTP-Version CRLF  
- **b**. The Resource Identified by a Request:

- **c**. Request Header Fields:The request-header fields are used to allow the client to pass additional information to the server like the request and the client itself. The request header fields act as request modifiers, with semantics equivalent to the parameters on a programming language method invocation.

## What are HTTP Request Methods?
- **GET** : This method retrieves information from the given server using a given URI. GET request can retrieve the data. It cannot apply other effects on the data.

**HEAD** : The HEAD method is the same as the GET method. It is used to transfer the status line and header section only.

- **POST** : The POST request sends the data to the server. For example, file upload, customer information, etc. using the HTML forms.

- **PUT** : The PUT method is used to replace all the current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

- **DELETE** : The DELETE method is used to remove all the current representations of the target resource, which is given by URI.

- **CONNECT** : The CONNECT method is used to establish a tunnel to the server, which is identified by a given URI.



## What is the Status Code?
The Server issues an HTTP Status Code in response to a request of the client made to the server. Status code is a 3-digit integer. The first digit of status code is used to specify one of five standard classes of responses. The last two digits of status code do not have any categorization role.


# HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are divided into five categories, each represented by the first digit of the three-digit code. Here are all the standard HTTP status codes:

## 1xx: Informational
- **100 Continue**: The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so.
- **102 Processing (WebDAV)**: The server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.
- **103 Early Hints**: Used to return some response headers before final HTTP message.



## 2xx: Success
- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.
- **202 Accepted**: The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.
- **203 Non-Authoritative Information**: The server successfully processed the request, but is returning information that may be from another source.
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.
- **205 Reset Content**: The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content and requires that the requester reset the document view.
- **206 Partial Content**: The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client.
- **207 Multi-Status (WebDAV)**: The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes.
- **208 Already Reported (WebDAV)**: The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a previous reply to this request and are not being included again.
- **226 IM Used**: The server has fulfilled a request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.



## 3xx: Redirection
- **300 Multiple Choices**: Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.
- **302 Found**: 302 Found redirect status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location header
- **303 See Other**: a response indicating that the requested resource has been moved to a new location and the client should make a new request to that location.
- **304 Not Modified**:  the requested resource has not been modified since the last time it was loaded, and there's no need to transfer it again
- **305 Use Proxy (deprecated)**: The requested resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is provided in the response.
- **306 Switch Proxy (unused)**: No longer used, but the code is reserved.
- **307 Temporary Redirect**: informs your browser that the requested content is temporarily located in another place
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: tells browsers and search engines that a resource has permanently moved to a new URL

## Difference between 302 vs 307 for Temporary Redirects?
A 302 redirect lets browsers use a different request from the original request. Whereas a 307 redirect requires the same request method for both the original request and the redirect.

This means that with a 302 redirect, visitors may use POST requests on the original page, and they can switch to GET method on the redirected page. On the other hand, a 307 redirect would force them to keep using POST.


## 4xx: Client Errors
- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. or the client request has not been completed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource.
- **402 Payment Required**: Reserved for future use.
- **403 Forbidden**: The request was valid, but the server is refusing action. The user might not have the necessary permissions for a resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. or  response status code indicates that the server cannot find the requested resource. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links and can be subject to link rot.
or A 404 status code only indicates that the resource is missing: not whether the absence is temporary or permanent.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: A request method is not supported for the requested resource.
- **406 Not Acceptable**: The requested resource is capable of generating only content not acceptable according to the Accept headers sent in the request.
- **407 Proxy Authentication Required**: The client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.
- **408 Request Timeout**: The server timed out waiting for the request.
- **409 Conflict**: Indicates that the request could not be processed because of conflict in the request, such as an edit conflict.
- **410 Gone**: Indicates that the resource requested is no longer available and will not be available again.
- **411 Length Required**: The request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource.
- **412 Precondition Failed**: The server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request.
- **413 Payload Too Large**: The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process.
- **414 URI Too Long**: The URI provided was too long for the server to process.
- **415 Unsupported Media Type**: The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support.
- **416 Range Not Satisfiable**: The client has asked for a portion of the file (byte serving), but the server cannot supply that portion.
- **417 Expectation Failed**: The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field.
- **418 I'm a teapot (RFC 2324, April Fools' joke)**: The server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot.
- **421 Misdirected Request**: The request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV)**: The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.
- **423 Locked (WebDAV)**: The resource that is being accessed is locked.
- **424 Failed Dependency (WebDAV)**: The request failed due to failure of a previous request.
- **425 Too Early**: Indicates that the server is unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed.
- **426 Upgrade Required**: The client should switch to a different protocol.
- **428 Precondition Required**: The origin server requires the request to be conditional.
- **429 Too Many Requests**: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").
- **431 Request Header Fields Too Large**: The server is unwilling to process the request because either an individual header field, or all the header fields collectively, are too large.
- **451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons**: The server is denying access to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.



## 5xx: Server Errors
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
- **501 Not Implemented**: The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unavailable (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance).
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
- **505 HTTP Version Not Supported**: The server does not support the HTTP protocol version used in the request.
- **506 Variant Also Negotiates**: Transparent content negotiation for the request results in a circular reference.
- **507 Insufficient Storage (WebDAV)**: The server is unable to store the representation needed to complete the request.
- **508 Loop Detected (WebDAV)**: The server detected an infinite loop while processing a request.
- **510 Not Extended**: Further extensions to the request are required for the server to fulfill it.
- **511 Network Authentication Required**: The client needs to authenticate to gain network access.





## What are Persistent Connections?
In HTTP/1.0, the connection is closed after a single request or response pair. In HTTP/1.1, a mechanism was introduced, which is known as keep-alive-mechanism. In this mechanism, a connection could be reused for more than one request.

## What is Session State in HTTP?
Session state is also known as Stateless state. HTTP is a stateless protocol. In the session state, the client and server just know about each other only during the current request. If the connection is closed, and two computers want to connect again, they need to provide information to each other as a new connection, and the connection is handled as the very first one.

## What is HTTP Message?
HTTP Message is used to show how data is exchanged between the client and the server. It is based on a client-server architecture. An HTTP client is a program that establishes a connection to a server to send one or more HTTP request messages. An HTTP server is a program that accepts connections to serve HTTP requests by sending an HTTP response messages.

## What is HTTP cURL?
HTTP cURL is a command-line tool. It is available on all major operating systems

## What is HTTP Response?
HTTP Response sent by a server to the client. The response is used to provide the client with the resource it requested. It is also used to inform the client that the action requested has been carried out. It can also inform the client that an error occurred in processing its request.

An HTTP response contains the following things:

Status Line
Response Header Fields or a series of HTTP headers
3Message Body
## What is HTTP Security?
HTTP is used to communicate over the internet, so users, information providers, and application developers should be aware of the limitations of security in HTTP/1.1. There are two methods to establish a secure HTTP connection: https URI scheme and the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header.


## Can you explain how HTTPS works and why it’s considered secure?.
HTTPS, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is a protocol used for secure communication over a computer network. It uses encryption to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. HTTPS operates through two main protocols: HTTP and SSL/TLS.

HTTP functions as the application protocol to transfer information on the web. However, it lacks security features which can expose data to potential threats. This is where SSL/TLS comes in.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a network. They use asymmetric cryptography for authentication, symmetric encryption for confidentiality, and message authentication codes for message integrity.

When a user connects to an HTTPS-secured server, the website sends its SSL certificate to the user’s browser. This certificate contains the public key needed to start the secure session. The two systems then go through a process called an SSL handshake, which establishes a secure connection between them.

This entire process ensures that any data transferred between the user and the site is encrypted and cannot be read by anyone else, making HTTPS secure.

## Why HTTPS is Considered Secure
Encryption:

HTTPS uses strong encryption algorithms (such as AES) to encrypt the data transmitted between the client and server. This prevents eavesdroppers from reading the data as it travels across the network.
Authentication:

The server’s certificate, issued by a trusted CA, authenticates the server’s identity. This ensures that the client is communicating with the legitimate server and not an imposter (protects against man-in-the-middle attacks).
Data Integrity:

HTTPS uses cryptographic hash functions and MACs to ensure data integrity. Any alteration of data during transit can be detected, preventing tampering.
Confidentiality:

The use of symmetric session keys for encryption ensures that even if someone intercepts the encrypted data, they cannot decrypt it without the session key.
Protection against Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:

The authentication and encryption mechanisms prevent attackers from intercepting, altering, or forging messages between the client and server.
Forward Secrecy:

Many modern HTTPS implementations use a feature called forward secrecy, which ensures that session keys are not compromised even if the server’s private key is compromised in the future. This is achieved by generating unique session keys for each session that are not derived from the server’s private key.


## How does HTTPS differ from HTTP? Why is it important?
HTTPS, standing for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is an extension of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The key difference lies in the ‘S’ which stands for secure. HTTPS employs SSL/TLS protocol to provide encrypted communication and secure identification of network servers, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.

HTTP transfers data as plain text, making it susceptible to eavesdropping attacks where unauthorized parties can intercept and view sensitive information. In contrast, HTTPS encrypts the data before transmission, rendering it unreadable to anyone except the intended recipient.

The importance of HTTPS cannot be overstated. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers could potentially steal or manipulate data being transferred. This is crucial when dealing with sensitive data such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal information.

Moreover, search engines like Google prioritize websites using HTTPS in their ranking algorithm, enhancing visibility and trustworthiness. Also, modern web browsers warn users when they visit non-HTTPS sites, impacting user confidence negatively.

## 3. What is the role of SSL/TLS in HTTPS?
SSL/TLS plays a crucial role in HTTPS by providing security for web traffic. It does this through encryption, authentication, and integrity checks. Encryption ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is unreadable to any eavesdroppers. Authentication verifies the identity of the parties involved in communication, preventing impersonation attacks. Integrity checks ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transmission. These three functions together provide secure HTTP communication, protecting sensitive information like credit card numbers or login credentials from being intercepted or manipulated.


## Question: How does HTTPS handle encryption and decryption?

HTTPS handles encryption and decryption through a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods.

Asymmetric Encryption (Public/Private Keys):

When a client connects to a server via HTTPS, the TLS/SSL handshake begins.
The server sends its digital certificate to the client, which includes the server’s public key.
The client verifies the certificate with a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and then generates a pre-master secret.
This pre-master secret is encrypted with the server’s public key and sent to the server.
The server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key.
Symmetric Encryption (Session Keys):

Both the client and server use the pre-master secret to generate symmetric session keys.
These session keys are used for encrypting and decrypting the data exchanged during the session.
Symmetric encryption, such as AES, is efficient and fast, ensuring secure data transmission.


## Can you describe the process of establishing a secure connection via HTTPS?
HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, establishes a secure connection through a process known as the SSL/TLS handshake. This begins when a client sends a “ClientHello” message to the server, specifying its capabilities. The server responds with a “ServerHello” message, selecting the highest level of security that both can support.

The server then provides its digital certificate, which includes its public key and is verified by the client using the certificate authority’s public key. If verification succeeds, the client generates a pre-master secret for session encryption, encrypts it with the server’s public key, and sends it back.

Upon receipt, the server decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key. Both parties now generate the master secret and session keys based on the pre-master secret. They exchange messages confirming this, after which all data transmitted is encrypted with the session key, ensuring a secure HTTPS connection.

## What threats does HTTPS offer protection against?
HTTPS offers protection against various threats. Primarily, it secures data transmission by encrypting the information sent between a user’s browser and the website they’re visiting, preventing eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks where unauthorized parties intercept and potentially alter the communication. It also provides authentication, ensuring that users are interacting with the intended website, not a malicious imitation, thereby mitigating phishing attempts. Additionally, HTTPS prevents tampering of data during transit, safeguarding integrity and thwarting injection attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection.

OR

HTTPS provides protection against several key threats:

Eavesdropping:

HTTPS encrypts the data transmitted between the client and server, preventing attackers from intercepting and reading the data as it travels over the network.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:

The TLS/SSL handshake ensures that the client is communicating with the legitimate server and not an imposter. This authentication process, backed by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs), protects against MitM attacks.
Data Tampering:

HTTPS ensures data integrity by using cryptographic hashes. Any attempt to alter the data during transmission can be detected, preventing tampering.
Phishing:

HTTPS can help users identify legitimate websites by checking the digital certificates. Browsers often display visual indicators, like a padlock icon, to signify that a connection is secure, making it harder for attackers to create convincing fake sites.
Replay Attacks:

By using unique session keys for each session, HTTPS makes it difficult for attackers to capture and replay previously transmitted data successfully.
Downgrade Attacks:

HTTPS prevents downgrade attacks where an attacker forces a connection to use weaker, less secure encryption protocols. Modern HTTPS implementations require strong encryption methods and will not fall back to outdated protocols.
Confidentiality Breaches:

The encryption used in HTTPS ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, personal data, and payment information, remains confidential and is not exposed to unauthorized parties.



## How does HTTPS contribute to SEO rankings?
HTTPS contributes to SEO rankings by enhancing website security, a factor that search engines like Google prioritize. HTTPS encrypts data transferred between the user’s browser and the server, protecting it from interception or tampering. This encryption builds trust with users, reducing bounce rates and increasing time spent on the site, both of which positively impact SEO. Additionally, Google has explicitly stated that HTTPS is a ranking signal, giving secure sites an edge in search results.

##  What are the main reasons for moving from HTTP to HTTPS?
HTTPS provides three key layers of protection: encryption, data integrity, and authentication. Encryption prevents eavesdropping by encrypting the data exchanged between the user’s browser and the website, ensuring privacy and security. Data integrity ensures that the data sent or received is not tampered with during transit. Authentication verifies the identity of the website to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. These protections are crucial in maintaining trust with users, especially when handling sensitive information like credit card numbers or personal details.


## Can you discuss some potential issues that might occur during the migration from HTTP to HTTPS?
Migration from HTTP to HTTPS can present several challenges. One common issue is mixed content, where a secure webpage loads insecure HTTP subresources, causing security vulnerabilities. Another problem could be the loss of referral data. When traffic passes from an HTTPS site to an HTTP site, it’s treated as direct and can skew analytics. Additionally, server load may increase due to the encryption process involved in HTTPS, potentially slowing down website performance. Redirects also need careful management; incorrect implementation can lead to loops or broken links. Lastly, SEO rankings might fluctuate temporarily during migration, although this usually stabilizes over time.

## How does HTTPS impact load times of a website?
HTTPS impacts website load times due to the additional steps required for secure communication. The process begins with a handshake between client and server, where they agree on encryption protocols. This involves exchanging public keys and creating a shared secret key. Once established, all data transferred is encrypted and decrypted at each end, adding processing time. Additionally, HTTPS requires more TCP packets than HTTP, increasing network latency. However, modern browsers support HTTP/2 over HTTPS which multiplexes requests, reducing the impact on load times.

## What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in HTTPS?
Symmetric encryption in HTTPS uses a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. It’s faster but less secure as the same key must be shared between sender and receiver, risking interception.

Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, employs two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This enhances security as the private key remains solely with the recipient. However, it is slower due to computational complexity.

## How can you ensure that an HTTPS implementation has been done correctly?
To ensure correct HTTPS implementation, start by acquiring a valid SSL/TLS certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Install and configure it on your server. Use HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce secure connections. Implement Server Name Indication (SNI) for hosting multiple certificates. Test the configuration using tools like Qualys SSL Labs’ SSL Server Test for vulnerabilities such as weak cipher suites or protocol versions. Regularly update and patch your server software to mitigate new threats.

## 14. How would you handle a mixed content warning on an HTTPS site?
Mixed content warnings occur when a secure HTTPS site requests insecure HTTP resources. To handle this, first identify the mixed content using browser’s developer tools. Then, modify your website to request these resources over HTTPS instead of HTTP. If the resource isn’t available over HTTPS, consider hosting it on your own server or find an alternative that is. For dynamic content loaded by JavaScript, ensure all API calls are made over HTTPS. Lastly, set Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to report and optionally block mixed content.

## Can you explain the HTTPS handshake process?
HTTPS handshake, also known as SSL/TLS handshake, is a process that establishes a secure connection between client and server. It begins with the client sending a “ClientHello” message to the server, specifying its capabilities such as supported cipher suites and TLS versions. The server responds with a “ServerHello” message, selecting from the options provided by the client.

The server then sends its digital certificate for authentication and may request the same from the client. Once authenticated, the server generates a session key, encrypts it using the client’s public key (from the certificate), and sends it back in a “Finished” message.

The client decrypts this session key using its private key. Both parties now have a shared secret key used for symmetric encryption of their communication. This completes the handshake, allowing encrypted data transfer over HTTPS.

## What are the differences between self-signed certificates and those issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) in HTTPS?
Self-signed certificates and CA-issued ones differ in their creation, trustworthiness, and usage. Self-signed certificates are generated by the user and not trusted by default as they lack a third-party validation. They’re typically used for testing or internal communications.

CA-issued certificates, on the other hand, are created and signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. Browsers inherently trust these due to the rigorous verification process undergone before issuance. These are used for public-facing production environments where trust is paramount.

The choice between self-signed and CA-issued depends on the application’s needs. For high-trust environments like e-commerce, CA-issued certificates are necessary. However, for development purposes, a self-signed certificate may suffice.

## 17. What is the role of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in HTTPS?
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) plays a crucial role in HTTPS by providing the framework for encryption and decryption processes. It involves two keys: a public key used to encrypt data, and a private key for decryption. When a user connects to an HTTPS website, the site’s SSL certificate, containing its public key, is sent to the user’s browser. The browser checks the certificate’s validity with the Certificate Authority that issued it. If valid, the browser uses this public key to encrypt sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers before sending them back to the server. The server then uses its private key to decrypt this data. This ensures secure transmission of sensitive data over networks, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.

## 18. How do you configure HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) and why is it important?
HSTS is configured by adding a response header named “Strict-Transport-Security” to the server. The value of this header defines the duration for which HSTS will be enforced, typically specified in seconds. For example: Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains.

HSTS is crucial because it mitigates protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It instructs browsers to only use HTTPS, preventing them from making insecure HTTP connections. If an attacker tries to trick a browser into downgrading connection security, HSTS prevents this, maintaining secure communication.

## 19. How would you solve an HTTPS error on a live site?
To solve an HTTPS error on a live site, I would first identify the specific error message. If it’s a certificate issue, I’d check if the SSL/TLS certificate is valid, properly installed, and matches the domain name. For mixed content errors, I’d ensure all resources are loaded over HTTPS by modifying URLs in the source code or configuring server to send HSTS header. In case of protocol or cipher mismatch, I’d update the server configuration to support modern protocols and ciphers. If there’s a DNS resolution error, I’d verify the DNS settings. Lastly, for 4xx/5xx HTTP status codes, I’d inspect server logs and application code to find and fix the underlying problem.

## 20. How does the browser verify the authenticity of an HTTPS server?
The browser verifies the authenticity of an HTTPS server through a process called SSL/TLS handshake. Upon connecting to the server, the browser requests the server’s public key along with its certificate. The certificate is then checked against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). If the CA that issued the server’s certificate is on this list, the browser trusts the server and proceeds to establish an encrypted connection using the server’s public key. This ensures data integrity and confidentiality during transmission.

## 21. Can you explain what is meant by ‘HTTPS Everywhere’? What are the benefits and drawbacks?
‘HTTPS Everywhere’ is a policy and practice of using HTTPS, the secure version of HTTP, across all web pages to ensure data security. It’s an extension for browsers that forces them to use HTTPS instead of HTTP, providing encryption and authentication.

The benefits include enhanced privacy and security by preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. It ensures data integrity as information cannot be modified during transit without detection. Also, it boosts SEO rankings as search engines favor HTTPS websites.

However, there are drawbacks. Transitioning from HTTP to HTTPS can be complex and costly, requiring technical expertise. There may also be performance issues due to the extra time taken for data encryption and decryption. Some older devices or systems might not support HTTPS, leading to accessibility issues.

## 22. How do ‘man in the middle’ attacks work and how does HTTPS prevent them?
‘Man in the Middle’ (MITM) attacks occur when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker can eavesdrop, manipulate data or impersonate one of the parties to gain unauthorized access.

HTTPS prevents MITM attacks by encrypting the data transmitted between the user and the server. It uses SSL/TLS protocols which provide a secure channel, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data. When a user connects to a HTTPS website, the website sends its SSL certificate for verification. This certificate contains the public key needed to start the secure session. The browser checks the validity of this certificate with the Certificate Authority that issued it. If valid, it creates, encrypts, and sends back a symmetric session key using the server’s public key.

The server decrypts the session key using its private key and sends an acknowledgment encrypted with the session key to start the encrypted session. Now, even if an attacker manages to intercept the messages, they won’t be able to understand them due to encryption, thus preventing MITM attacks.

## 23. What are cipher suites in HTTPS and how do they work?
Cipher suites are a set of algorithms used in HTTPS to secure network connections. They consist of four components: key exchange, bulk encryption, message authentication, and pseudo-random function algorithms.

Key exchange algorithm facilitates the secure exchange of keys between client and server. Bulk encryption algorithm encrypts the actual data being transmitted. Message authentication code ensures data integrity by detecting alterations. Pseudo-random function generates master secret for session keys.

During an HTTPS connection setup, the client sends a list of supported cipher suites. The server picks the most secure suite that both support. This chosen suite is then used throughout the communication session ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged.

## 24. How does SSL pinning work and why is it important for HTTPS connections?
SSL pinning, also known as certificate or public key pinning, is a process where specific cryptographic identities are associated with a server. This association ensures that during the SSL handshake, the client checks if the server’s certificate matches the pinned certificate in the application. If there’s no match, the connection is terminated.

This mechanism enhances HTTPS security by mitigating man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. In such attacks, an attacker intercepts and possibly alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. By using SSL pinning, even if an attacker presents a valid certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority, the connection will not be established because it doesn’t match the pinned certificate.

Moreover, SSL pinning provides additional protection against rogue Certificate Authorities. It prevents them from issuing fraudulent certificates for domains they don’t control.

## 25. Can you discuss a time when you had to troubleshoot an issue dealing with HTTPS? How did you approach it and what was the outcome?
During my tenure at XYZ Corp, I encountered an issue where our website was not loading securely over HTTPS. My approach involved three steps: identifying the problem, diagnosing its cause, and implementing a solution.

The problem was identified through user reports of security warnings when accessing our site. Upon investigation, I found that while our SSL certificate was valid, it wasn’t properly installed on our server. This diagnosis was made using online SSL checkers and by manually inspecting the server configuration.

To resolve this, I reinstalled the SSL certificate correctly, ensuring all intermediate certificates were also in place. Post-installation, I verified the secure connection using various browsers and SSL validation tools. The outcome was successful; users no longer received security warnings and our website loaded securely over HTTPS.
